# Blend

This folder is for the blend quiz on the udacity course. I created a function in python to blend an image using the equation:

BlendImage = ( 1 - alpha )image2 + (alpha)image1

where:  

BlendedImage = The combination of the two images blended together  
alpha = The percent of image 1 that will be included in the blend.  
image1 = The first image.  
image2 = The second image.
