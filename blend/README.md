# Blend

This folder is for the blend quiz on the udacity course. I created a function in python to blend an image using the equation:

where:  

BlendedImage = The combination of the two images blended together  
\alpha = The percent of image 1 that will be included in the blend.  
image1 = The first image.  
image2 = The second image.  

Side note: This one looks zoomed in too???
